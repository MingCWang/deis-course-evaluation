Inspired by Patricia Hill Collins’ 2004 monograph Black Sexual Politics, this seminar asks: how have Black women, Black queer people, and Black gender-expansive people in America used culture and social movements to create in-group knowledge and to challenge linked racial-sexual structures of oppression? How have different practitioners created and revised theories of sexuality depending on time and place? Students will emerge from this seminar with a deepened understanding of Black feminist theoretical vocabularies including but not limited to: the politics of respectability, the culture of dissemblance, ungendering, fungibility, theories of the flesh, pleasure, and misogynoir.

    "courseDescription": "Although adoption has a storied past spanning a range of diverse cultural, geographic, and temporal settings, the adoption of children across national boundaries is a relatively new phenomenon—one that emerged in tandem with America’s postwar expansion into Asia. Today, international adoption is a normalized and accepted institution that helps to express dominant US ideologies of humanitarianism, internationalism, and multiculturalism. But American’s sudden and unprecedented desire to adopt children from abroad was anything but natural, informed instead by the dynamic geopolitical imperatives of the early Cold War years. Since then, the knowledge production around international adoption in the United States has been dominated by American social workers and adoptive parents. This 2-credit hour practicum interrogates the knowledge production about international adoption that has historically privileged perspectives from the receiving country or that of adoptive parents in particular. Instead we investigate the cultural, ethnic, and racial experiences of transnationally, transracially adopted individuals as well as their birth families long overlooked in adoption studies.

Most of us would agree that infrastructure should be a public thing, serve society, and allow for better life, communication, and activity. Yet infrastructures are often hidden, subterranean, and therefore prone to exploitation and hijacking. The anthropology of infrastructure aims in part at making it more visible and at deciphering the complex interaction between things, society, and politics. But anthropologists end up unearthing more than utility networks and urbanism plans. They stumble upon the very power of inanimate things to orient our experiences, from the most intimate (having sex) to the least material of them (browsing the internet). From politics to ethics and back, this course will explore our relationship to infrastructure. Usually offered every second year."

    "courseDescription": "Encompasses the many facets that may present themselves to a researcher working in a laboratory setting. The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today's research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway & Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial & yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project. Currently we are massing useable data from past classes for publication purposes. This class has a large time commitment both during and outside of class time and should not be taken in conjunction with other research laboratories or internships. Please note that one of the goals of this course is to help place you in or on the career path you desire. Usually offered every year. Usually offered every year.,The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology so students can establish a skill set that makes them viable in today's research job market. The secondary goal is to encompass the many aspects that present themselves to a researcher working in a laboratory setting. A final goal is to help place you on the career path you desire. The class projects aim to answer real research questions posed by Brandeis principal investigators, create a research environment that prepares students for a career in science, and allows them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research.  For Fall of 2022 there will be four possible projects. These will consist of: A) trying to enhance the binding efficiency and overall performance of a thermophilic polymerase, commonly used in PCR reactions, by adding a non-specific DNA binding domain.  B) continuing our screen of small chemical molecules on a model system that may inhibit the production of toxic proteins called Shiga toxins that can lead to Hemorrhagic Colitis in people. C) refine our search for genes that might be responsible for the extracellular transport of ATP. D) a new project that is to be determined.  Students will have their choice to investigate 2 out of the 4 projects for the semester.

For Fall of 2022 there will be four possible projects. These will consist of: A) trying to enhance the binding efficiency and overall performance of a thermophilic polymerase, commonly used in PCR reactions, by adding a non-specific DNA binding domain.  B) continuing our screen of small chemical molecules on a model system that may inhibit the production of toxic proteins called Shiga toxins that can lead to Hemorrhagic Colitis in people. C) refine our search for genes that might be responsible for the extracellular transport of ATP. D) a new project that is to be determined.

Most of the times, these interactions are good, but principle of pathogenicity will also be covered. Classes will build up from basic microbiology, cell biology and evolution concepts and advance to mechanistic insights of how simple organisms can create complex ecosystems. We will discuss microbial interactions that have been known for centuries, long before any modern concept of the cell was established, the current state-of-the-art knowledge and what to expect for future discoveries. This course will also introduce the most important techniques historically used to study microbial interactions, giving emphasis to optical microscopes.

Students will learn fundamental concepts of infectious disease spread, including basic concepts of disease ecology, transmission, virulence, immunity, vector, and host susceptibility in the population. Then focus shifts to how natural and human-driven activities (e.g., climate change, deforestation, travel, and development) affect disease transmission and emergence. Examples of diseases to be covered include COVID, influenza, Ebola, malaria, SARS, avian flu, etc. Students will draw on relevant case studies to explore how threats from previous outbreaks may shift under a changing climate, rising globalization, and environmental degradation.

A major theme throughout this course will be the global culture of the cosmopolitan world created by Alexander the Great. Other themes will include encounters between varying cultural traditions, how material correlates of identity played out in all levels of society, and how the art, artifacts, and architecture of the Hellenistic communities were used to assert themselves in a rich multi-cultural environment.

Every aspect reflects a purposeful choice: material, mode of manufacture, shape and finish, place and way of use. And pottery is ' and was ' everywhere: it is the single most abundant type of artifact found on almost all archaeological sites. Archaeologists use pottery to elucidate everything from personal habits to broad social, economic, and political developments.

Puppets, dolls, clockwork creatures, golems, robots, supercomputers, and A.I.s radically repose the question of what it means to be alive – and, in the process, apply pressure to commonsense notions of what is exclusively human. We will trace a line of thinking from Pinocchio and Frankenstein’s Monster to Battlestar Galactica and Kazuo Ishiguro’s Artificial Friends. How does fear of – and longing for – the more-than-human figure of the automaton illuminate our political and social world? Special one-time offering, spring 2022."

The Psychology of Finance builds on the insights of psychology to enhance our understanding of such real world phenomena. It starts by asking: How do people actually think? As psychologists began documenting a century ago, normal human thinking deviates in predictable ways from the traditional assumption in academic finance: “perfect rationality.” Perfectly rational individuals make decisions following the rules of logic and statistics textbooks; they see the world accurately, and they have perfect recall. This course introduces you to some of these predictable deviations and shows how they help explain a wide range of economic behavior and market outcomes. Why do stock prices, house prices, and exchange rates sometimes go through bubbles and crashes? Why do retail investors trade too much, and why don't they diversify enough? Why don't people save enough for retirement? Special one-time offering, fall 2022."

Public schools pride themselves as neutral playing fields when it comes to matters of religion. But this position belies a more complicated history. American public schools were initially founded by protestant leaders concerned with an influx of non-protestant immigrants during the middle of the 19th century. Indeed, despite lip service to ideas like separation of Church and state, American educational leaders long saw schools as a vehicle for promoting a Protestant inflected American culture. This course begins from the premise that American education and American religion have always existed in relationship. Religious groups have sometimes tried to use the public schools as vehicles to advance their religion, sometimes, they have created supplemental schools, and sometimes they have created whole parallel school systems. But in all cases, education and religion in American are intertwined. This course asks when education is religious and when religion is educational. It examines a series of case studies drawn from different faith communities including Judaism, Evangelical Christianity, Catholicism, and Islam. Usually offered every second year."

In this course, participants practice classroom structures in which students, rather than teachers, do the bulk of the intellectual work. The course examines the small interactions in classrooms (micro) to understand big ideas about education (macro). Taken in conjunction with ED 211A Classroom Teaching Practicum. Primarily for students pursuing the Massachusetts teaching license in secondary education, either through the MAT program or seniors in the Teacher Education minor."

Like many European intellectuals, they saw in these developments the promise of major social change which would vindicate the ambitious optimism of the Enlightenment. The collapse of the French Revolution into violence and terror struck a blow to their hopes, their morale and their world-view. British literature of the Romantic age reflects this initial enthusiasm, the subsequent disappointment, and the painful effort of recovery. We will read 18th-century manifestos defending human rights by Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft; works of ardent support for the Revolution by first-generation Romantic poets such as Wordsworth and Coleridge; their later works grappling with the Revolution’s failure; and the reflections of the second-generation Romantics (Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley) as they struggle to find new grounds of political hope.

We will be examining the history of the constructed image alongside artistic approaches to image making, involving intervention and manipulation of a subject. In direct opposition to the methods of the candid and documentary genres in photography and film, the constructed image depends on artifice and invention to create or manipulate the subject. This genre makes use of a vast range of techniques including staging, directing, collaging, sculpting and painting, as well as creating a performative studio-based practice, where images are fabricated instead of being \"found.\""

In the aftermath of the Revolution (1910-1920), Mexican muralism emerged as the platform to promote ideals of social cohesion in a ravaged nation. In the throes of building a new national consciousness, Mexican artists deployed an avant-garde aesthetic that would influence muralist movements, and the forms of social critique associated to them, across the continent. With a historical perspective, we will study how muralism—an intervention of public space—supports struggles for representation through time. Paying special attention to Mexican, Chicano, and American artists—and to a lesser extent, Southern Cone and Caribbean artists—we will study how muralism combats multiple forms of oppression while addressing timely sociopolitical concerns. The course covers works from the early twentieth century to the present. Special one-time offering, spring 2021."

As we engage central historiographic debates about the timing and location of the transition to capitalism in the United States, we will use the concept of capitalism as a tool to better understand and differentiate the wide range of economic systems that have existed in the nation’s history. Topics include: the rise of wage labor and the expansion of markets; slavery and emancipation; territorial conquest; technological and infrastructural development; the rise of big business and organized labor; alternative labor regimes and the experience of work; the economic dimensions of gender, race, and other categories of social difference; social welfare policy; and recent developments in deindustrialization, globalization, and income inequality.

In the last quarter of the twentieth century, states started to cede infrastructure to capitalist firms, privatizing key utilities and, increasingly, demurring from the responsibility to regulate these firms. By digging up the hidden history of infrastructural development, this class will reframe how we conceptualize the role of government in laying out the foundations for social activity, and give us the tools to intervene in contemporary debates over who should build, control, and maintain our infrastructure.

Most people have no problem naming several capital cities, whether they are county, state, national or imperial, contemporary or historical, official or unofficial. You may have heard of summer and winter capitals. Yet when we stop to consider what 'capital' means, what makes a capital exactly that, many possibilities emerge. Does anything unite them? And what roles did they play in the history of the places for which they were capital? This seminar explores the idea and phenomenon of 'capital city' in order to problematize and defamiliarize this term, that is, to cast doubt on the assumption that it is a universal concept whose meaning, form and role are shared across polities and cultures."

The second failure relates to our use of poor energy, primarily fossil fuels, major hydro, and conventional nuclear power. For SID graduates to fully appreciate the nature of these two kinds of energy challenges, and to potentially work in organizations focused on overcoming these challenges, it is necessary to master some of the fundamentals of both climate and energy science.

The focus of this course will be on both integration of religious identity factors into conflict analysis and an introduction to faith-based interventions skills, used by religious actors to foster coexistence. During the course, we will explore different types of contemporary conflict in which religion functions as a conflict driver, including how to understand and handle conflicts perpetrated by extremist religious groups. We will also explore the diversity of faith-based reconciliation processes (such as hospitality, healing ritual, apology, etc.) as well as the kinds of roles performed by a wide variety of religious actors (education, advocacy, mediation, dialogue facilitation, etc.). Examples and case studies will be drawn from a wide variety of religious traditions and diverse cultures. In addition to those cases presented in the readings and by the professor, each student will be required to select cases on which to make a class presentation and write a paper. The purpose of these assignments, and the course in general, is to provide students the opportunity to assess concrete conflict situations in which religious identity is a factor, know the potential contribution that faith-based actors can make to coexistence, and evaluate how best to function in faith-based peacebuilding roles and reconciliation processes that interest them.

While this course aims to contribute to the development of students' capacity to think critically and strategically about current challenges and approaches in disaster management, it recognizes the rich experience of the students and strongly encourages peer dialogue and group sharing. Usually offered every year.,In recent decades there has been growing attention on the need to systematically understand and manage risk, while mitigating the vulnerabilities of communities to disasters. In light of this to what extent has the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) model contributed to improving humanitarian preparedness to disaster? How have links between humanitarian and development assistance evolved? What are the professional and technical approaches needed in disaster response environments?

    "prerequisites": "To study environmental justice and the human effects of climate change is to study historical and continuing environmental harms that have disproportionately affected communities of color in the United States and around the world, and to consider what blend of science, policy, advocacy, and leadership it takes to ensure the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. ",
    "courseDescription": "In this course, students will study at the intersections of environmental history, climate science, ecology, poverty, race and gender inequity, and public health. Readings draw on the work of climate  scientists, investigative journalists, ecologists and environmentalists, engineers and technologists,  community and social justice advocates and civic leaders, poets, policy makers and lawyers,  economists, financial investors, historians, and medical professionals. The majority of readings and  other source materials are authored and compiled by women and people of color across generations  and geography. We will focus on understanding how human health, well-being, and life trajectories  are inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment, and how the linkage occurs through the use of natural resources, the consequences of extracting those resources, and the impact on the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the green spaces, land, lakes, oceans, and rivers we enjoy, and overall ecosystem quality and integrity.

The strongest source of causal evidence is from well-designed randomized trials but such data are rarely available for most policy questions. Instead, causal inference must be drawn from observational studies. This course begins by examining the concept of the target trial, along with two major causal inference frameworks—Directed Acyclic Graphs and Potential Outcomes. We then briefly review several causal inference methods from the econometrics literature. Next, we will examine a series of methods from epidemiology that are commonly used to draw causal inference from observational health care data. Finally, we consider relatively new methods using machine learning techniques that, when used within a causal inference framework, may substantially improve our ability to draw causal inferences relative to traditional methods. For each method, we will consider the theory and methods, as well as practical applications from the literature. Usually offered every year."

The purpose of the course is to open a tool box with potential methods so students learn the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and when to use them. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) have become the gold-standard to judge the causal impact of interventions in development but face many limitations and a growing chorus of critics who advocate a more eclectic approach. We start the course with RCTs but quickly move on to examine near neighbors that merit attention because they can also show causal impacts. In fact, near neighbors can sometimes do a better job than RCTs in impact evaluations. The neighbors considered in this course include propensity score matching, instrumental-variable estimations, intent-to-treat, and natural experiments. One important gap in all the evaluation literature is how to deal with puzzles after an evaluation. In the course we break new ground by examining the use of ethnographic and other methods to return to the field to answer puzzles left by the initial evaluation. Usually offered every year."

And the political power of capital often blocks policies that might allow the economy and society to become both more efficient and more just.

When people make decisions, they draw on data, models (mental or formal), and goals that are shaped by their own experiences and the contexts—political, organizational, and otherwise—in which they are immersed. Decision making often suffers when situations include uncertainty, dynamically complex problems, high stakes, and time and performance pressures. We will look for connections between how people make decisions and the organizational outcomes we experience. The course will include a mix of some basic tools, such as linear programming and causal loop diagramming, and some more macro level reflection on decision processes in health care environments. To assist this reflection, the course introduces the tools of systems thinking for modeling and analyzing organizational policy and strategy. Using role playing games, simulation models, case studies, and management flight simulators, we develop insights essential to managing in a world characterized by dynamic complexity.

The seminar recognizes, as far as possible, that people will bring different knowledge, intellectual concerns, experience and interests. It is not about the United States, although many of the readings are drawn from the United States and Britain. Usually offered ever year.,This required seminar surveys different theoretical paradigms of social policy formation and social change while considering the subject from a number of positions, perspectives, and disciplines.  The disciplines comprise multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary research. The goal is to acquire a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations that underpin robust social policy innovation. The seminar aims to enhance awareness of the following: the range of interrelated goals of social policy; debates on the means and ends of social policy formulation and its implementation; and the effects of power and politics when it comes to social policy discussions in the public sphere. We will examine contemporary events, movements, and developments in the U.S., not precluding other comparative contexts in a broader global landscape.  These point to various social justice issues: wealth and assets inequality; education; health disparities; migration and immigration; housing equity; law and voting rights; youth, family, and communities; and the role of civil society in relation to the state.  We will explore these topics in relation to critical race studies, critical disability studies, gender and sexuality studies, and theories of intersectionality.  By equipping students with various approaches, the goal is to integrate theory with quantitative and qualitative research methods that could inform eventual dissertation proposals.

    "courseDescription": "Have you ever read a story and wondered if it could be real life? Or read a story and imagined yourself as a character in its fictional world? Remember when you were a child experiencing many firsts, and asking why, or how? Works of fiction have a magic of revitalizing the reader’s curiosity and imagination. Science fiction, particularly, gets the readers excited about understanding how the world works and imagining their place in it. In this course, we use science fiction stories to build a fresh relationship with math and science and feel empowered to stay curious and ask questions. We attempt to answer some of the scientific questions by a powerful tool: mathematical modeling. As we embark on this journey, we learn how to become better friends with our computers by learning a little about their language. By the end of the course, MATLAB might become your favorite smart pocket calculator. The word ‘science fiction’ might give you mixed feelings: if you have ever tried to imagine yourself in a science fiction world but it felt like an exclusive club, prejudiced based on gender identity, sexual orientation, race, disability, and more, this course gives you the chance to reimagine a more inclusive science fiction world. Every two weeks, we read a science fiction story by a diverse group of writers, including Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Ken Liu, and Rebecca Roanhorse, who strive to make the science fiction community more inclusive. We also hear from a diverse group of speakers who discuss topics in race, gender, culture, and equity in scientific or science fiction communities. If the pandemic era has sparked your curiosity about the spread of diseases and you have found yourself watching documentaries on infectious diseases back-to-back, rejoice. In the first half of the course, we focus on topics in epidemiology and population growth, and ask questions like how long would it take for a vicious fungus to take over the world? Or if an alien parasite infected our planet, how could we model its spread as it takes over more human hosts? In the second half, we focus on bio-engineering models that inevitably lead us to questions surrounding climate change. Can we engineer our planet and control climate? As climate change has affected the frequency of natural disasters, can we predict earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes accurately? If all fails, is space going to be a second home for us? By the end of the course, we reevaluate our definition of science. What are our responsibilities towards, the consequences of, and limitations of using science to progress humanity? We will feel empowered and inspired to shape science into a more inclusive home for all. Special one-time offering, spring 2022."

Chants that had been taught orally for several centuries began to be encoded on parchment using signs placed above text syllables that recorded the shape and contour of the chant melodies. Systems of music notation spread rapidly across Europe, and took root as the way to record, archive, share, and (eventually) compose music. This graduate seminar course examines the form and function of music notation in western Europe, and how the writing down of music transformed music practice. Students will transcribe music from a variety of medieval and Renaissance notation systems, and will work directly with high quality facsimiles and online reproductions of the original manuscripts.

Do dreams tell the future? Can dreamers control their dreams? Can dreams be harnessed for good, or to do harm? Who is a trustworthy dream interpreter? How do dreams manifest in the body? The texts will include guidance for dream-healing from the Dead Sea Scroll community, a handbook on dream interpretation in the Talmud, texts from medieval Europe, and a handbook on dream interpretation by a Turkish rabbi, which gained immense popularity across the Jewish world in the 16th century.

In the earliest moments of Western philosophy, Socrates distinguished himself by asking, \"How should one live?\" Increasingly, however, that question and its variants have taken a back seat in philosophy, abandoned to the best-seller lists and to publications produced by recent graduates of assertiveness training workshops. We reclaim these questions and take them up again from within the discipline of philosophy itself. Questions asked include: \"How should I live?\" \"What are the good things in life?\" \"Does life have meaning?\" Readings include Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud, Murdoch, Dennett, Dawkins, Hacking, Nozick, and Nagel.

Usually offered every second year.,To a considerable extent, the “quasi-worship” of Science (the capital “S” signifying science as ideology) replaced the worship of God that held sway for millennia, until Nietzsche announced in the nineteenth century the “death of God.” Unlike religion, however, Science offers no guidance for our day to day lives, no consolation for the bitterness of life and the somber death knell of our mortality. Nature abhors a vacuum, however, and the vacuum left by the “death of God” was filled by a movement that arose from the ashes of WWII in France and Germany, inspired by earlier thinkers like Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, that became known as existentialism. Leading figures included Martin Heidegger, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Existentialism circled around a common set of ideas: existence vs. essence; radical human freedom vs. mere unfree, already determinate “things”; being vs. “nothingness”; what it means to live in an “absurd” universe; and “the time of life\" vs. the (“timeless”) time proposed (seemingly) by modern physics.

The majority of the remaining elements we are made of were formed in stars in various processes generally summarized under the term nucleosynthesis. In this course we will follow the evolution of the elements and isotopes from the Big Bang to today’s composition of the Solar System. We will discuss the basic physics behind these processes and look at astronomical observations and laboratory measurements of stardust grains that confirm current nucleosynthesis theories. In addition we will analyze open questions of this state-of-the-art research field to decipher what future measurements and observations will be required to solidify our understanding. This course will be a mixture between a classically taught course and a reading. Various topics and their underlying physics will be introduced on the (virtual) board. We will then read and discuss original scientific literature – historic articles and recent ones – to solidify the learned material. Usually offered every year."

    "courseDescription": "The United States and China are now the two most powerful nations in the world. Their relationship is important and complex. It is not only bilateral but also international, involving key nations in Asia, Oceana, North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Russia. How the U.S. and the PRC manage this relationship will impact a) who rules the world—authoritarian China or democratic America and its allies--and b) whether the intensifying competition between these two superpowers explodes into war. We will focus on both the past and the present relationship. We will pay special attention to the attempt of the PRC ruling group to drive the U.S. out of the Western Pacific, and to how the U.S. and U.S.-aligned democracies (including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, India, and Australia) are dealing with this challenge. We also will focus on the economic competition to control and dominate new internet ecosystems, smartphone technologies and new generation 5-G technology, Blockchain technology, maritime logistics infrastructure and global supply chains, information systems used to track online dissidents, and critical national defense and strategic military technologies. We also will study China’s expansion into Southeast Asia, the South China Sea, and Africa, focusing on the U.S. response to China’s attempt to seize land and mineral resources and develop industrial and technological infrastructure in these areas. In this edition of the course, we are particularly interested in whether current militant nationalism, combined with China’s economic woes, might increase the prospects for a war with the U.S. and its allies over Taiwan or the South China Sea, which in either case would greatly damage the global economy. Usually offered every year."

National identity plays a key factor in performances and can spark controversy, unity, or both. How can Eurovision help us understand the evolving role and significance of national identity? What is national identity and how is it used? What shapes, extends, and limits identity and how does this intersect with the nation? In this course we will look at some theories about nations and national identity, examine the performative aspects of identity, and, of course, enjoy some performances from the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest.

Forensic techniques, later discredited, have also led to false convictions: a man was found guilty of rape and spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence; a convicted arsonist was proven innocent but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science. We will investigate the work of forensic scientists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as CSI or Bones. Usually offered every year.,In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim's DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer ' a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier.

    "courseDescription": "Dr. Lisa Sanders, a columnist for The New York Times, writes, “The experience of being ill can be like waking up in a foreign country. Life, as you formerly knew it, is on hold while you travel through this other world as unknown as it is unexpected.” While many view illness as personal, we are also surrounded by those who want to share their stories. Given each individual’s unique experience, how do we talk about illness, and what do our descriptions reveal about us and our communities? To explore these questions, we will first read When Breath Becomes Air, the self-told story of a Stanford neuro-surgeon whose world is flipped when he is diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 lung cancer: the doctor who treats patients with brain disease is suddenly the patient with a terminal illness. In addition, we will analyze blogs, podcasts and articles in a variety of disciplines to see how they approach both physical and mental illness. Later in the semester, students will research the story of an illness of their choice and may choose from texts including written narratives, films, works of art and other mediums."

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Crime narratives have served a variety of purposes throughout American History. During the Colonial and Early Republican period, published execution confessions and sermons communicated the perils of criminal activity. Sensationalized accounts of cases such as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 and the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, “The Black Daliah,” helped sell millions of newspapers. Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood transformed true crime into a literary art form. Today, fans of true crime can find entire television networks and podcasts devoted to the subject. True crime is entertainment—but what does that tell us about American culture? How does the genre shape our view of the justice system and the nature of crime itself? Is there anything “true” about True Crime? Students will engage with and write about primary sources which span the Colonial period to the present in an effort to contextualize the phenomenon of crime as entertainment.

A thick accent, bunch of grammar errors, jumble of different languages, and so on: it feels embarrassing to speak “bad” English. We casually hear or say, “you speak very good English!” Is it a compliment or insult? What do we assume as “bad” and what counts as “good”? In this seminar, we will look into how different forms of English are represented and consumed in literature, film, video, and visual art, starting with the film Lost in Translation. Students are welcomed to bring in and share their own experiences on issues including “foreignness,” migration, language learning, and translation, to name but few. By focusing on how multiple Englishes meet and clash in fictional and real environments, we will try to rethink the hierarchies of language and culture. Our ultimate goal is to reflect on how this conversation could influence both our class environment and daily lives. Usually offered every year."

We will explore questions of identity, sociology, history, culture, and aesthetics. This course will encourage us to think about questions including: How does a minority voice make itself heard by an often indifferent cultural majority? How does one politically persuade an often hostile audience? How is one’s personal history and sense of identity influenced by historical, political, and cultural circumstances? What happens at the intersections of gender and race? In this class we will grow as readers and writers as we listen to the voices that have already discussed these issues, and as we craft our own responses to these questions.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Joey and Chandler, Woody and Buzz, Thelma and Louise, Hermoine and Harry: over the years, television and movies have provided numerous definitions of “friendship” through various depictions of “besties” and “bosom-buddies.” These definitions naturally reflect the changing societal values and cultural norms from which they emerge. The same can be said for depictions about friendship from the ancient world. The relationships between Ruth and Naomi, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, David and Jonathan, or Achilles and Patroclus can provide rich insight into the boundaries of friendship that still hold true today. In this course, we will consider numerous depictions of friendship and consider what assumptions they convey in their time and place. Through reading a novel or short story from popular culture or the ancient world, watching a television episode of Friends or Black Mirror, or critically examining a movie like Toy Story or Clueless, we will seek answers to questions like: What are the benefits of friendship? What role does gender play in friendship? What do friendship-depictions tell us about how audiences view and participate in friendship? Our understanding will be facilitated through modern studies of friendship from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Through engagement with primary source material in combination with class discussions, we will learn analytic and writing skills that will enable us to think critically about what it means to be a friend.

    "courseDescription": "What constitutes an ideal world? The word utopia, taken from Sir Thomas Moore’s 1516 text of the same name, describes one such type of imagined ideal community in which social issues such as poverty, violence and disease are largely eliminated. In contrast, dystopias present us with imagined societies characterized by despotic regimes, ecological catastrophe, and widespread disease. With works such as The Hunger Games series, the TV version of The Handmaiden’s Tale, and so many more, dystopian fiction is currently experiencing quite the revival. Yet dystopias do not merely exist within fiction, they are a very real part of our world. It could even be argued that the popularity of dystopian fiction today is indicative of an increasing anxiety regarding the myriad potential dystopias that lurk just beyond the horizon. Within this course, we will examine popular dystopian fiction and film of the 20th and 21st centuries and connect the themes we encounter with real-world issues. In doing so, we will consider the ways in which dystopian worlds contend with a vast array of themes and topics, including (but not limited to) inter/national politics, ethics, society-building, war and violence, environmental concerns, and issues of race and gender."

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. The development of social media, now so important in our lives, has caused huge changes in popular culture. It is now more democratic, more diverse, more open, and more political than ever before. Still, some of the same old problems persist. As noted intellectual Mary Beard argues, “there are countless examples of attempts to write women entirely out of public discourse.” Another prominent woman, lyricist, artist, businesswoman, and philanthropist Taylor Swift calls out this issue in simpler terms: “when everyone believes ya, what’s that like?” Beard and Swift both raise the same central question: who is allowed to speak in public, and who is believed? Furthermore, why do we see figures in popular culture as more or less credible than one another? What kind of identities (race, gender, or class) and social messages are involved in this process of divining the truth from multiple people’s perspectives? These are the questions at the heart of this course, which will focus on modern figures of popular culture—celebrities, politicians, activists, and fictional characters—to help us understand the complex relationship between truth and power.

In this University Writing Seminar, we will look closely at contemporary food culture, examining everything from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos to films like Ratatouille and popular cooking competition shows such as Chopped and Top Chef. How do power and oppression influence our relationship with food? How do our communities, class status, and ethnic and national identities shape our consumption? Through the media we analyze and our class discussions, students will learn to use close reading and analytical writing as tools for thinking critically about the cultures that surround food in our modern world."

    "courseDescription": "The United States, ostensibly “the land of the free,” currently has over 2.2 million prisoners––more than anywhere else in the world. Despite a steady decline in crime rates from the 1980s onward, thousands of new private and federal prisons have been constructed and filled to capacity, a phenomenon we now call “mass incarceration.” The occupants of these facilities are overwhelmingly Black and Latinx, half of whom serve time for nonviolent crimes. How and why did this happen? The radical feminist and prison abolitionist Angela Davis suggests an answer to this question, contending that prison, by providing a way to contain “disposable” populations, actually “relieves us of the responsibility of seriously engaging with the problems of our society.”"

This connection between the mind and the self extends to writing, where literature is often seen as an expression of our thoughts and, therefore, ourselves. Yet, writing is also an action performed by a body. So, what does it mean to write while having a body or about having a body-- particularly a body that is disabled? In this course, we will study texts by disabled authors such as poetry from Jillian Weise and Ilya Kaminsky, essays by Leslie Jamison and Michel de Montaigne, and films such as Tod Browning’s Freaks (1932) and Tom McCarthy’s Up (2009). Through these works, we will consider the vexed intersections of body and mind, thought and action to explore issues such as societal attitudes about disability, the social and medical models of disability, representations of disability in culture and literature, and conceptions of the self and the other."

Since we've been inundated with quantitative data, you likely know what it's like to experience data as an audience member, however in this course, you'll become the composer with data at your communicative disposal. This course will encourage you to think about questions like: What is public health data? How is data generated and collected? How is public health data used or misused in academic, professional, and societal contexts? How do writers frame data to achieve certain ends? How does data visualization relate to communication? We will explore these questions across a variety of texts including CDC and NIH publications, TedTalks, and academic articles.

Unfortunately (or fortunately!), much of a naturalist's practice involves writing. In fact, the same holds true for those in other scientific fields'scientists must not only do science, but they, too, must write science. But what exactly are professional scientists writing? What motivates their composing and to whom do they write? What rhetorical choices do scientists make when communicating complex information? In this course, we'll examine the discursive and generic requirements scientists face when composing in different contexts for different audiences. By considering a number of professional scientific genres'including research articles, grant applications, poster presentations, and public talks'we will explore questions of accessibility, writerly agency, persuasion, and objectivity. You'll even have the opportunity to interview faculty members in the disciplines to learn about the writing tasks you might encounter as a working professional in your field. By the end of this course, you'll have a more sophisticated understanding of professional writing in the sciences, and as such, you'll be asked to produce two distinct genres of writing that take up the same research topic, albeit for different audiences and different communicative purposes.

How do intersections of social class, mental health, and physical ability impact the discourse about race and gender in sports? In this class, we will investigate the history of racist and sexist policies and practices in amateur and professional sports as well as developments that place sports on the cutting edge of gender and racial equality in society at large. Case studies will include the raised fist salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, the passage of Title IX, current debates about financial compensation for elite NCAA athletes, and Colin Kaepernick's kneeling for the national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing, and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors.,This section of UWS focuses on 'Environmental Justice,' which encompasses the equal access of all people, regardless of race, ethnic origin, or socio-economic status, to the benefits of nature as well as the equitable distribution of environmental harms. It gives visibility and voice to those who have been historically marginalized and suffered the most from environmental hazards and the effects of climate change: communities of color, indigenous peoples, and the poor. The course invites students to examine power inequities, historical contexts, and scientific concepts to understand the causes and effects of environmental injustices and environmental racism. It also invites students to explore stories of resilience and hope by researching, learning, and writing about inspirational individuals, groups, and movements who have taken action for a more just and equitable future.

    "courseDescription": "Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone, the gold rush, and Conestoga Wagons. When we think of the American West, we might envision images of cowboys and Indians, of danger and folk heroes. But these images mask a darker side of struggles and colonization; some even argue that Westward expansion in the 19th Century lay the roots for American expansionist policies in the Cold War era and beyond. This course will interrogate these seemingly conflicting narratives. We will first watch the classic John Ford western film, Stagecoach, in which the mysterious cowboy/outlaw character, Ringo Kid, helps to protect a group of innocent pioneer townsfolk on a dangerous stagecoach trip across the American Southwest. For the research essay, students select a topic and text of their choice, ranging from the film Pocahantas, to a painting by Georgia O'Keefe, to a classic novel by John Steinbeck, in order to explore the idealization of the American West and the lingering effects of that idealization today.

Given how core the language of territory and borders is to how we understand what we know'What 'field,' for example, are you thinking of majoring in?'this course will consider borders metaphorically as well as literally. In both of these contexts, what does it mean to be a citizen, or a migrant, or a tourist? What are the documents that confer or communicate these identities? We will read from fiction, watch movies, and listen to podcasts to think critically about the boundaries that separate physical spaces, as well as those that separate conceptual spaces like fields of knowledge and genres. Further, we will think through the decisions that we make as writers when wandering through these spaces, while representing the identities we and others claim in them. Specifically, we will focus on what documents and data can and can't capture, as well as how they can, at different times, reinforce or break down the boundaries we draw. Usually offered every year."

Discussing issues like digital redlining, recidivism assessment, and facial recognition, we will consider the extent to which the digital technologies that shape our daily experiences when sorting through information can potentially cause harm. Moreover, we will consider our role in resisting the categories chosen for us when sorting through the content we engage, in spaces ranging from social media to grocery stores ' thinking, perhaps, about the times we are asked to be algorithmic ourselves as readers and writers.

Through literature, film and essays, this course will examine the shame that so often contributes to homelessness and discuss what it will take to shift this self-perpetuating cycle. Weekly reading responses, lively debate and your own mock profile of a person experiencing homelessness will help us address our individual and collective response to this national crisis. Guest speakers from area shelters will contribute to the discussion, and you will be prompted to dive deep into your own relation to homelessness through short essay assignments.

We will look at technology, agriculture, urban planning, forestry, and social movements as lenses through which to interpret that relationship.

    "courseDescription": "Cultural heritage—which includes a diversity of tangible (e.g., artifacts, monuments, buildings) and intangible (e.g., language, folklore, traditions) elements of culture—is a vital part of how we understand ourselves and the world. Here in Boston, we have a particularly close relationship with the cultural heritage of the founding of the United States; a stroll along the Freedom Trail will lead one past historically “sacred” sites such as the Old North Church and Bunker Hill, as well as to sites reminiscent of daily life such as the Boston Common and the Paul Revere House. However, communities in the United States and around the world often have a fraught relationship with cultural heritage because of the ways that it has been shaped by legacies of colonialism and oppression. These complexities are evident in longstanding debates around the repatriation of objects—such as the Elgin Marbles from Greece or the Benin Bronzes from what is now Nigeria—and in recent protests advocating for the removal of Confederate monuments. In this course, we will examine some of the conversations surrounding tangible cultural heritage. Who has the “right” to own objects? Who controls what stories are told about cultural heritage? And how do those stories shape our understanding of our place in the world? Usually offered every year."

As the great composer John Cage observed, “Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise.” How can we turn noise to our advantage so that it enhances rather than disrupts mindfulness?

    "courseDescription": "In recent news, Adnan Syed – the lead figure in the seminal true crime podcast Serial – was released from prison after twenty-three years. Syed had been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Hay Min Lee, but the podcast shed enough doubt on the conviction that a court eventually overturned it, leading to Syed’s release. At the same time, many have noted that the emergence of true crime podcasts and docuseries has its roots in the exploitation of people’s misery for the entertainment of the masses (and the financial benefit of the media outlets). In this course, we will examine the ethics of this genre. We will read texts in ethical philosophy (authors like Kant, James, and Mill), as well as arguments about true crime series themselves. In the end, we will have examined some of our own beliefs about right and wrong, and will have conducted a critical investigation into the culture that surrounds us. Usually offered every year."

But how do we define, identify, and recognize beauty? Why do we seek it out; why must we strive so hard to achieve it? And why does it often have such an ugly underbelly? This course will examine culturally and historically contingent ways of defining beauty, analyzing how constructs of racialized, classed, and gendered attributes at different historical moments factor into what counts as beautiful, fashionable, or desirable. We also will parse the values and ideals promoted by our own moment through a wide variety of selections from recent pop-culture and mass-media campaigns: music videos, such as Beyonce’s “Pretty Hurts,” reality TV clips, such as America’s Next Top Model, Instagram trends including #iweigh and #freethepuff, and advertisements for cosmetics and clothing, such as Aerie’s “real” campaign and Sephora’s “We Belong to Something Beautiful.” Nonfiction articles, book chapters, and documentary clips on the globalized beauty industry (cosmetics, plastic surgery) will offer critical and theoretical lenses to consider where and how beauty works.

As we analyze a wide array of media including literature, film, painting, photography, dance, and music, we will investigate how form shapes – and is shaped by – the anxieties and opportunities afforded by replication. What makes a good copy? Why is the relationship between original and copy so contested? How do cloning and copying – whether historical or present day – force us to rethink the boundary between life and art, to renegotiate our ideas of what it means to be a human, a self, a unique individual?

    "courseDescription": "The zombie genre is a staple of horror. But in the same way that most art is a reflection of society, authors, filmmakers, and creators have used the zombie hoard to interrogate important issues in society. Max Brook’s World War Z is really a critique of the failures of global disaster preparedness. George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead has been broadly interpreted as a meditation on consumer culture. Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend asks the question \"what does it mean to be human?” The un-dead are a blank canvas, ready to become what we believe them to be. In this way, they are an effective vehicle for cultural commentary. This class will use novels, comics, film, and television to investigate the zombie genre as a form of social critique. Topics will include immigration and migration, disaster preparedness, sickness and death, the essence of humanity, mourning and loss, and climate change.

Masterpieces like Art Spiegelman’s Maus, Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, and Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home are now common inclusions in high school and college curricula. These works share an uncanny ability to take difficult subjects — e.g., warfare, violence, and family trauma — and portray them in a human dimension that is accessible to readers of all ages and backgrounds. Other texts in the genre depict lighter subject matter, but these also claim to represent the past through images drawn much later in time than the episodes that they depict actually occurred. What is it about comics as a medium that draws artists to reflect on their personal experiences and enchants readers to engage? What should we make of the connection between lived reality and its portrayal in comics? Are comics more or less “real” than other media like text, photography, film, and paint?"

As it turns out, intelligent machines have enslaved the minds of humans, and Neo is merely a cog in their grand scheme to access solar energy. While this film may seem far-fetched, philosophers have debated whether or not we truly have free will for millennia. At stake is our understanding of ourselves, our place in the world, and how we ought to judge the behavior of others. While the free will question is far from settled, the tools of science may be able to get us closer to an answer. From the fundamental structure of the universe to how our brains operate, science can help determine what kind of control is possible and how we actually make decisions. This course will examine the implications of theories and experiments in physics, psychology, and neuroscience for the free will debate.

Films such as Her prey on these fears when the film’s protagonist falls in love with and takes advice from his AI assistant, Samantha. Looking beyond AI, the use of technology raises a host of other questions. For example, should social media companies restrict speech on their platforms? Do interactions in video games have different social rules than real life? These questions each come with their own distinct considerations but are united by a common theme—life in the digital age and the related ethical implications. Determining our moral obligations when using or developing technology has important consequences, ranging from our interpersonal relationships to the very fate of humanity.

In this class we will explore the American Dream within the social, economic, and cultural context of capitalism.

    "courseDescription": "By 2050, the United Nations estimates the world population will exceed 9.6 billion people, a number that is challenging for its environmental, economic, and political impacts. This dilemma, while seemingly unique to our own moment, has haunted us since the rise of cities in the late eighteenth century and Thomas Malthus’ famous text, An Essay on the Principle of Population in which he incorrectly predicted a global food shortage by the mid-1800s, but sparked an ongoing debate over progress, poverty, and population that persists to this day. Fears over population growth have infiltrated cultural narratives as well – morphing into stories of class conflict, pandemics, environmental destruction, and procreative control. This University Writing Seminar will examine dystopian films which engage in population paranoia. Students will read Malthus’ Essay and watch films and shows as Metropolis, Soylent Green, WALL-E, Children of Men, 3%, and 28 Days Later to consider how anxieties about population growth balloon to grotesque proportions in horror and dystopian cinema. Students will write three essays: The first will be a close reading essay which focuses on evidence and analysis of a course film. The second will be a lens text utilizing Malthus’ Essay. The final essay is a research essay that participates in the critical conversation around a film and topic related to the course of their choosing."
